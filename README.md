<h2>Small description of the application</h2>
This is a small app for creating/editing/deleting invoices for companies. <br>
The main functionality is pretty intuitive - on the main page user can find table and buttons for controlling it.<br>
The initial data is uploaded to redux state from a json object when the main page is rendered. Then all the components work with redux state. <br>
Forms are made with Formik npm package have basic validation, but nothing has been said specified about it. <br>
Design is made using Material UI <br>
In the code you can find comments where API requests are supposed to be sent if it was used. <br>
<h2>Small description of the way I worked</h2>
First of all when I was given the task to create react app using Material UI, Formik and Redux I understood that I have good knowledge only of Redux out of that list, so I started investigating on Material UI and Formik. I googled some templates to understand the main principles and then I started thinking how the data flow and components will be organized. After the theoretical part I started the implementation. I was doing it when I had free time and was adding things step by step, starting from UI going to dataflow.
<br> 
The only difficulties I have were related to getting used to new techs, because I wanted to polish my app.





## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br>
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
